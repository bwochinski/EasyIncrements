# EasyIncrements
Easy Increments is a simple and flexible incremental game engine written in Javascript and using  HTML5 canvas to display the game.

There is documentation on the wiki which should allow you to get started, and most features are used in the example game included. I'm sure many other things are possible as well, if you code them creatively.

The current release of the engine, using the example game "Coiny Clicker", can be played here: http://bwochinski.github.io/EasyIncrements/example.html

### Thanks

I'd like to thank neurofluxation for his incremental game tutorials, which provided the inspiration and a good chunk of the original codebase for this project. They are available here: http://incremental.barriereader.co.uk/?v=25
