# EasyIncrements
Easy Increments is a simple and flexible incremental game engine written in Javascript and using the HTML5 canvas element to display the game.

The original codebase and concepts are credited to neurofluxation (http://incremental.barriereader.co.uk/?v=25), though they have been greatly expanded upon and further separation created between engine systems and game logic.
