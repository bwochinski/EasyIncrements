# EasyIncrements
Easy Increments is a simple and flexible incremental game engine written in Javascript and using the HTML5 canvas element to display the game.

I will be adding documentation to the wiki soon, but until then most features are used in the example game included. I'm sure many other things are possible as well, if you code them creatively.

### Thanks

I'd like to thank neurofluxation for his incremental game tutorials, which provided the inspiration and a good chunk of the original codebase for this project. They are available here: http://incremental.barriereader.co.uk/?v=25
